# Belly-Button-Challenge

Overview
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, revealing insights into the microbial species present in individuals' belly buttons.

The main aim of this dashboard is to provide users with an engaging interface to explore the diversity of microbial species found in human navels. Users can select individual samples from a dropdown menu to view detailed information about the microbial composition and visualize the data through interactive bubble and bar charts.
